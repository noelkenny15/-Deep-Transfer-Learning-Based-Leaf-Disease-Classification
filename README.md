# -Deep-Transfer-Learning-Based-Leaf-Disease-Classification
This project is a deep learning-based leaf disease detection system that utilizes transfer learning to identify and classify 33 different types of leaf diseases. Trained on a vast dataset of images, the model is designed to assist agricultural professionals and enthusiasts in quickly and accurately diagnosing plant diseases.
## Usage:
To use the model for leaf disease detection, follow these steps:
- Make sure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries installed. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to set up the required dependencies.
  pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run main.py:
  streamlit run main.py
## Model Details:
The leaf disease detection model employs deep learning techniques and utilizes transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained knowledge of a base model. It has been trained on a dataset featuring images of 33 different leaf diseases. For details on the architecture, dataset, and training process, please refer to the provided code and documentation.
## Acknowledgements:
We sincerely appreciate the contributions of the open-source community and the creators of the base model that this project is built upon. Your work and support are invaluable to us.
